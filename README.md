## Prerequisites

* Python 3.13 (project-local virtual environment in `backend/.venv`)
* Node.js LTS (v24.x) + npm
* Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend
* PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) recommended for the `.ai-workflow` scripts

## Local services and ports

| Service    | Port  | Purpose                        |
|------------|-------|---------------------------------|
| backend    | 8000  | FastAPI application             |
| frontend   | 3000  | Next.js development server      |
| postgres   | 5432  | Primary relational database     |
| redis      | 6379  | Cache / session store            |
| qdrant     | 6333  | Vector store (HTTP), 6334 (gRPC) |

## Getting started (local development)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and review every value — **do not** put real
   credentials or patient data in it. This step is manual and intentional.
2. Backend:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
   .venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -m "not integration"
   cd ..
   ```
   This runs only the unit tests — no PostgreSQL, no Docker, no database
   environment variables, no destructive-reset authorization required. See
   "Running tests" below for integration tests and the full quality gate.
3. Frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Infrastructure:
   ```powershell
   docker compose config
   docker compose up -d postgres redis qdrant
   ```

## Multi-tenant foundation (local API testing)

The backend now has a tenant/membership domain and tenant-scoped demo API
(`/api/v1/tenant-context`, `/api/v1/tenant-resources`), plus clinic and staff
administration (`/api/v1/clinic`, `/api/v1/clinic/staff`) — see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) → "Multi-tenancy" and "Clinic and staff
administration". Real login/session authentication now exists too (see
"Authentication (local testing)" below); the **development-only** identity
header provider described here remains available as a lower-friction way to
exercise tenant-scoped routes without creating an account, and is disabled
by default.

1. Enable it only in a `development` environment (`.env`):
   ```env
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   DEVELOPMENT_IDENTITY_ENABLED=true
   ```
   The application refuses to start if this is `true` outside
   `ENVIRONMENT=development`.
2. Every request to a tenant-scoped route must carry two headers:
   `X-Dev-User-Id: <uuid>` and `X-Tenant-Id: <uuid>`. These identify the
   caller and the tenant they're claiming to act in; the server always
   re-validates both against the database (tenant active, membership
   active) before granting access — the headers are a claim, not
   authorization.
3. Run migrations against your local Postgres (see "Local services and
   ports" above for connection details):
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .venv\Scripts\python -m alembic upgrade head
   ```
   A `Tenant` and an active `TenantMembership` row must exist for the
   `X-Tenant-Id` / `X-Dev-User-Id` pair you use — this foundation stage has
   no tenant-provisioning UI or endpoint, so insert them directly (e.g. via
   `psql` or a short Python script using the app's models) before testing.
4. Run tests — see "Running tests" below for the two supported workflows.
5. To exercise the admin UI (`/settings/clinic`, `/settings/staff`) against
   this backend: start the frontend (`npm run dev` in `frontend/`), open
   either page, and enter the same `X-Dev-User-Id`/`X-Tenant-Id` pair from
   step 2 into the "Development identity" banner shown at the top — it is
   stored in the browser's `localStorage` only, never a security boundary,
   and is attached as headers to every API call the page makes.

## Authentication (local testing)

The backend now has production login/session authentication
(`/api/v1/auth/*`) — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) → "Authentication
and user identity" and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) → "Authentication threat
model". This is independent of the development identity headers described
above; a real session always takes priority over a dev header when both are
present.

1. Run migrations (adds `user_accounts`, `auth_sessions`, `one_time_tokens`
   on top of the existing tenant/membership tables):
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .venv\Scripts\python -m alembic upgrade head
   ```
2. This foundation stage has no account-provisioning UI or self-signup
   endpoint. Create a `UserAccount` directly (e.g. via a short Python
   script using `app.core.passwords.hash_password` and the app's models,
   the same way you'd insert a `Tenant`/`TenantMembership` row today) before
   testing login.
3. Start the backend and frontend, then open `/login` and sign in with that
   account's email/password. A successful login sets the session and CSRF
   cookies; `/settings/*` pages then use the session automatically
   (`frontend/app/lib/api.ts`) — no dev-identity headers are required once
   logged in.
4. Login is throttled per (email, client IP) via Redis
   (`LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`/`LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` in
   `.env.example`) — make sure `docker compose up -d redis` is running, or
   rate limiting fails open (allows the request) rather than blocking login
   entirely; see `SECURITY.md`.
5. Password reset (`/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) and invitation
   acceptance (`/invitations/accept`) issue and validate tokens
   server-side, but **no email is sent** — there is no delivery mechanism
   in this foundation stage. The `one_time_tokens` table only ever stores
   a SHA-256 **hash** of the token (see `SECURITY.md` — a raw token is
   never persisted, so it cannot be recovered from the database, and it
   must never be logged either). The only place the raw token exists is
   the return value of `PasswordResetService.request_reset` /
   `InvitationService.create_invitation` at the moment of creation — the
   production API routes deliberately discard it. To exercise either
   flow locally:
   - preferred: see the automated coverage in
     `backend/tests/integration/test_password_reset_service.py` and
     `test_invitation_service.py`, which call these methods directly and
     use the returned raw token exactly as a real client would;
   - for manual exploration, call the same service method from a local
     Python shell (`.venv\Scripts\python`) against your dev database,
     capture the returned string in that shell session only, and build
     the URL by hand, e.g.
     `http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=<raw token>` — never
     print/log it, and never commit anything that does.

## Appointments and calendar (local testing)

The backend now has a rooms/service-types/provider-schedules/calendar-blocks
configuration layer, a dynamic availability engine, and the full appointment
lifecycle (`/api/v1/rooms`, `/api/v1/appointment-service-types`,
`/api/v1/provider-schedules`, `/api/v1/calendar-blocks`,
`/api/v1/availability`, `/api/v1/appointments`) — see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) → "Appointments and calendar" and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) → "Appointments and calendar threat model".

1. Run migrations (adds `tenants.timezone` plus the six new calendar tables,
   and requires the PostgreSQL `btree_gist` extension for the
   provider/room double-booking exclusion constraints — the migration
   itself runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist`, so no manual
   setup is needed as long as the database role can create extensions,
   which the default `docker-compose.yml` Postgres role can):
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .venv\Scripts\python -m alembic upgrade head
   ```
2. A `Tenant` has its own IANA `timezone` (default `Europe/Sofia`) — every
   schedule/availability/appointment-time calculation for that tenant
   resolves through it. Set it directly on the row if you need a
   different timezone for local testing; there is no settings-UI field
   for it yet.
3. Start the backend and frontend, sign in (or use the development
   identity headers as above), then open `/calendar` for the day/week
   booking UI (a view-mode toggle switches between them), or
   `/settings/rooms`, `/settings/service-types`, `/settings/schedules`,
   `/settings/blocks` for the configuration screens.
4. A booking needs, in order: an active room (optional) and service type
   (`/settings/rooms`, `/settings/service-types`), a `ProviderSchedule` for
   the staff member acting as the provider (`/settings/schedules` — any
   active `TenantMembership` user id works, there is no separate
   "provider" role/record), then `/calendar` → "New appointment" → "Find
   available slots".
5. This foundation stage sends no appointment confirmation/reminder
   emails, has no dedicated practitioner-profile module, and stores no
   patient record beyond the per-appointment contact snapshot — see
   ARCHITECTURE.md's "Known limitations" for the full list. Do not claim
   otherwise in operator-facing material.

## Running tests

Tests are split into two pytest markers: unit tests (no database
required) and `integration` tests (require a real, disposable, explicitly
authorized Postgres test database — see `backend/tests/db_safety.py`).
**No script ever derives or falls back to a test database automatically —
a test database must always be explicitly configured and authorized.**

### Unit checks (no Postgres required)

```powershell
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -m "not integration"
```

Ruff and mypy also require no database:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m ruff check .
.venv\Scripts\python -m mypy app
```

### Full local quality gate (starts its own disposable test database)

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .ai-workflow\scripts\run-tests.ps1
```

This runs ruff, mypy, and the unit tests directly, then runs the
integration tests via `.ai-workflow\scripts\run-local-integration-tests.ps1`
— a dedicated wrapper that:

1. starts (or verifies) the repository's own `postgres-test` Compose
   service (`docker compose --profile test up -d postgres-test` —
   a separate container, `tmpfs`-backed, sharing no volume with the normal
   `postgres` service, defined in `docker-compose.yml`);
2. independently verifies the running container really is that dedicated
   service (checks its `POSTGRES_DB`, and that the resulting URL is not
   equal to `DATABASE_URL`) before doing anything destructive;
3. sets `TEST_DATABASE_URL`/`ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_TEST_DB_RESET=true` **only**
   for that pytest child process;
4. runs the integration tests, then stops `postgres-test` (pass
   `-KeepRunning` to leave it up for a follow-up run).

It never touches the normal `postgres` service or its data. Run it
directly if you only want the integration suite:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .ai-workflow\scripts\run-local-integration-tests.ps1
```

### CI / explicit configuration

Set both variables explicitly before invoking either pytest or
`run-tests.ps1`, and the generic scripts will use exactly what you set
(without ever deriving or falling back to anything else):

```powershell
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<a database whose name contains 'test'>"
$env:ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_TEST_DB_RESET = "true"
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -m integration
```

`backend/tests/db_safety.py` refuses to run destructive setup — before
opening any database connection — unless **both** of the following hold:
* `TEST_DATABASE_URL`'s database name ends with `_test` or contains
  `test`, and it does not resolve to the same host/port/database as
  `DATABASE_URL`;
* `ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_TEST_DB_RESET=true` is set explicitly — by you, by CI,
  or by `run-local-integration-tests.ps1` after its own verification above.
  No script ever sets this automatically or falls back from
  `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to `DATABASE_URL`.
